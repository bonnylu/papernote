	Generalizing from a Few Examples: A Survey on Few-Shot Learning
	• Definition
D = {Dtrain,Dtest} consisting of a training set
Dtrain = {(xi ,yi )} small data set for training, and a testing set Dtest = {xtest}

	• Types
Classification: N-way-K-shot classification, Dtrain contains I = KN examples from N classes each with K examples
Regression
Reinforcement learning: for robotics

	• Compare with weakly supervised learning
FSL becomes weakly supervised learning problem only when prior knowledge is unlabeled data and the task is classification or regression

	• Methodology 






	• Embedding Learning







	• Applications
	character recognition
	image classification
	video application
	Robotics
	Natural Language Processing
	Acoustic Signal Processing
	drug discovery
